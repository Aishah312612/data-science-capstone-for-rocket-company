## Data Collection and Preparation
- **Data Acquisition**: Historical launch data was sourced from SpaceX’s public API.
- **Data Cleaning**: The data was processed to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness for analysis and modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **SQL Analysis**: SQL queries were used to retrieve and filter data for key insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Scatter plots, pie charts, and geospatial maps (via Folium) were utilized to visualize trends such as landing success rates and site characteristics.

## Predictive Modeling
- **Feature Engineering**: Key features were engineered from the dataset to enhance the prediction model’s performance.
- **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Several machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall used for model comparison.

## Dashboard Development
- **Design**: An interactive dashboard was developed using Plotly Dash to visualize key metrics such as launch success rates, geospatial landing site data, and model predictions.

## Proximity Analysis
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Landing sites were analyzed using geospatial techniques to assess how proximity to certain geographical features impacts landing success.

## Insights and Interpretation
- **Business Impact**: Findings highlight potential strategies for improving Falcon 9 landing success rates, such as optimizing landing site selection and refining predictive models to enhance safety and reduce mission costs.

## Presentation and Reporting
- **Slide Deck**: The results were summarized in a professional slide presentation, detailing the project’s objectives, methodologies, insights, and recommendations for SpaceX’s operations team.
